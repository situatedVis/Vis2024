                Vogue or Visionary? Current Challenges and Future Opportunities in Situated Visualizations
            </h1>
            <div class="center">
                <b><i>Situated visualizations</i></b> are visual data representations that are deeply integrated with the spaces, objects, and activities in a physical environment. Situated visualizations enable people to take advantage of data to support their work or daily activities, while minimizing the cognitive effort of accessing and using that data within physical environments.
                They display data in close proximity to <i>physical referents</i>, or physical objects to which the data refer. Situated visualizations may be created with a variety of technologies including small displays and mobile devices, augmented reality goggles, handheld projectors, and data physicalizations. Evidence suggests that situated visualization tools can reduce the friction of interacting with data in the context of physical world activities, serve as reminders for data actions, and encourage engagement and reflection.
                <br><br>
                Yet situated visualizations have not be widely adopted, in part because there is little design guidance. Numerous challenges remain, including context switching (e.g., between primary physical activities and secondary visualization tasks), integration with existing systems (e.g., manufacturing equipment), alignment with physical referents (which may move), potential interference or distraction from primary tasks (which in some contexts could be dangerous), the need for people to learn and adopt new technology into well ingrained workflows and the need to accommodate individual differences and accessibility.
                New technology is enabling, but is it just a fad? This panel will discuss and debate these questions to clarify the current challenges as well as future opportunities for situated visualizations.

                <br><br>
                From 2012-2014 I was a post-doctoral researcher in the AVIZ group at INRIA-Saclay in Paris. 
                Prior to that, I completed my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley's Department of Computer Science, 
                where I was advised by Maneesh Agrawala and was a member of the Berkeley Institute of Design (BiD)
                and the Visualization Lab. I also raced mountain bikes with the Cal Cycling team.
                I'm originally from southern Colorado and completed my undergrad at CU Boulder.
